--For this project, I downloaded a database which contained 11 tables. I explored the data and answered various questions that pertained to the information within the database.

--Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US
SELECT customerID, firstname, lastname, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> "USA";

--Show only customers from Brazil
SELECT customerID, firstname, lastname, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = "Brazil";

--Find the invoices of customers who are form Brazil (showing the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country)
SELECT inv.invoiceid, cust.firstname, cust.lastname, inv.billingcountry, inv.invoicedate 
FROM chinook.invoices inv
JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON inv.customerid = cust.customerid
WHERE cust.country <> "Brazil";

--Show the Employees who are Sales Support Agents
SELECT firstname, lastname, title
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title = "Sales Support Agent";

--Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the invoice table
SELECT distinct billingcountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

--Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT emp.lastname, emp.firstname, inv.invoiceid
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON emp.employeeid = cust.supportrepid
JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON inv.customerid = cust.customerid;

--Show the invoice total, customer name, country, and sales agent name for all invoices and customers
SELECT cust.lastname, cust.firstname, cust.country, inv.total AS invoice_total, emp.title AS employee_title, emp.lastname, emp.firstname
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON emp.employeeid = cust.supportrepid
JOIN chinook.invoices inv
ON cust.customerid = inv.customerid;

--How many invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT count(invoiceID)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate LIKE "%2009%";

--What are the total sales for 2009
SELECT SUM(total) AS '2009_Sales_Total'
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE invoicedate LIKE "%2009%";

--Write a query that includes the purchased track name and artist name with each invoice line ID
SELECT i.invoicelineid, artists.name AS 'Artist_Name', tracks.name AS 'Track_Name' 
FROM chinook.invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.tracks tracks
ON i.trackid = tracks.trackid
JOIN chinook.albums albums
ON tracks.albumid = albums.albumid
JOIN chinook.artists artists
ON artists.artistid = albums.artistid;

--Write a query that shows all the tracks, and include the album name, media type, and genre
SELECT t.name AS 'Track_Name', a.title AS 'Album_Name', mt.name AS 'Media_Type', g.name AS 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.albums a
ON t.albumid = a.albumid
JOIN chinook.media_types mt
ON t.mediatypeid = mt.mediatypeid
JOIN chinook.genres g
ON t.genreid = g.genreid;

--Show the total sales made by each sales agent
SELECT e.title, e.lastname, e.firstname, i.total
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON e.employeeid = c.supportrepid
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.customerid = i.customerid
GROUP BY e.lastname;

--Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT e.title, e.lastname, e.firstname, i.total
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c
ON e.employeeid = c.supportrepid
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.customerid = i.customerid
WHERE i.invoicedate LIKE "%2009%"
GROUP BY e.lastname
ORDER BY i.total desc
LIMIT 1;
