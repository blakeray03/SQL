--In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

--How many orders were placed in January?

--How many of those orders were for an Iphone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)

WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
AND Product='iPhone';

--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=Feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity)*price Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY Revenue asc;

--Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, Sum(Quantity), Sum(Quantity)*Price as Revenue, location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
